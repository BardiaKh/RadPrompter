Carefully review the provided chest CT report (in the <report> tag). Ensure that each data element is accurately captured.

Here is the report:

{{report}}

Please pay attention to the following details:
- Your attention to detail is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the medical records. 
- You should not confabulate information, and if something is not mentioned, you should assume that it is `Absent` unless otherwise stated.
- The report may contain additional information that is not relevant to the requested data elements. Please ignore that information.
- We are interested at findings at the time of scan, not the previous ones, so only consider the impression and findings sections of the report.
- Do not print anything else other than the provided output format.
