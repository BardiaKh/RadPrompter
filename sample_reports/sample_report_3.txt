Here is an example radiology report describing subsegmental pulmonary emboli:

Clinical Information:
65-year-old male with history of recent surgery presenting with pleuritic chest pain. Rule out pulmonary embolism.

Technique:
CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast was performed.

Findings: 
The main pulmonary arteries are patent and normal in caliber. No evidence of central pulmonary embolism.

There are few subsegmental pulmonary arterial filling defects identified within the right lower lobe and left upper lobe, compatible with subsegmental pulmonary emboli.

No large pulmonary infarcts are seen. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis is present.

The heart size and pulmonary vascularity are within normal limits. No pleural effusions.

Impression:
1. Subsegmental pulmonary emboli within the right lower lobe and left upper lobe.
2. No central pulmonary emboli or evidence of right heart strain.
3. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis.

Recommendation:
Clinical correlation is recommended regarding need for anticoagulation given the subsegmental nature of the emboli. Follow-up imaging can be considered if symptoms persist or worsen to evaluate for interval development of more proximal clot propagation.

Patient should be clinically risk stratified for bleeding risk versus benefit of anticoagulation for subsegmental pulmonary emboli based on symptoms and risk factors.
